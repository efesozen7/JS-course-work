DOM Project on the JavaScript course by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy - built with the help of the instructor

This project was built throughout the online course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real Projects!" by Jonas Schmedtmann
HTML and CSS code belongs to him and was used by me for educational purposes. The JavaScript code belongs to me but it was written 
with the guidence of the course instructor Jonas.
